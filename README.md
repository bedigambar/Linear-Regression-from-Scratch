# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch in Python using NumPy. It is designed as a learning exercise to deepen understanding of the mathematical concepts and implementation details behind one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning.

## Features

- **No external ML libraries:** The model is built using only NumPy for numerical operations.
- **Manual gradient descent:** The training process implements the gradient descent optimization algorithm step by step.
- **Intuitive code structure:** Each function is clearly commented to help understand the linear regression pipeline.
- **Educational focus:** The code is organized to make the math behind linear regression transparent and easy to follow.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the inputs (X) and the output (y).

The objective is to find the best-fitting line (in higher dimensions, a hyperplane) by minimizing the mean squared error between the predictions and the actual values.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bedigambar/Linear-Regression-from-Scratch.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Customization

- Adjust the learning rate and number of iterations as needed.
- Use your own datasets by modifying the data loading section.


## Acknowledgements
